# Dev-it-Yourself

This repository is a "lesson plan" of projects that reimplement well-established programs. Each project is designed such that the resulting program can be used as a simplified replacement for the original, implementing just enough functionality to get a sense of the core principles.

The aim is to give learners a way to practice their programming skills in real-life scenarios, with the added ability of being able to verify their implementation using tools that they may already use on a regular basis.
